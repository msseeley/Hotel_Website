# Description
This project is based on a CSS tutorial. The objective is to practice CSS concepts to create a basic website, in this case, for a mock hotel.

## Core Concepts
- Box Model
- Positioning
- Selectors
- CSS organization
- Floats and Alignment
- Classes and Ids

## Limitations
As a basic tutorial, this design is not responsive and doesn't employ more modern principles like responsive design or modern frameworks such as CSS Grid or Flex-box.
